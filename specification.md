# Text to roadmap tool

Convert text from following formats to roadmap

- It should support arbitrary time periods (e.g. Q1, T1, Months) that are just title
- It should support defining item lengths based on time periods (e.g. Q1 start, Q2-Q1 length, or Q1+(Q2-Q1)/2 as start)
- It should support swimlanes for teams (where items are grouped)
- It should generate svg image and enable copying a draw.io diagram (drawn svg should be something that can be implemented in draw.io diagram)
